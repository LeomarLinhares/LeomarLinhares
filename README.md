# Hi there 👋

<p>My name is Leomar da Silva Linhares, a brazilian guy and I am 24 years old.</p>
<p> I am currently learning the basics: HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I start to look at programming because of a personal project that NEEDS to get off the ground and I can't do this without programming. It's a game, so I intend to learn C#.</ p>
<p> I am hungry for challenges, especially for beginners/intermediate. So, if you stopped by and have challenges to refer me, say hello! 😄 </p>

## What I want to learn
:pushpin: - React<br>
:pushpin: - Python<br>
:pushpin: - C#
